# Tower Defense Game 
Welcome to the Tower Defense game! This game allows players to strategically place towers and soldiers to defend their headquarters against waves of enemies. This README file provides an overview of the game and instructions on how to play.

# Game Objective
The objective of the game is to protect your headquarters from enemy attacks by strategically placing towers and soldiers along the enemy's path. The game is played in waves, with each wave consisting of multiple enemy units. Your goal is to eliminate all the enemies before they reach your headquarters.

# Gameplay
At the start of the game, you will have a certain amount of in-game currency that you can use to purchase towers and soldiers. Towers are stationary defense structures that automatically attack nearby enemies, while soldiers are mobile units that engage enemies on the ground.

To purchase a tower or soldier, click on the respective icon in the game interface and then click on a valid placement location on the game grid. Each tower or soldier has a cost associated with it, so ensure that you have enough currency before making a purchase.

Once you have placed your towers and soldiers, click the "Start Wave" button to begin the enemy wave. Enemies will start moving along a predetermined path towards your headquarters. Towers and soldiers will automatically engage enemies within their range.

As enemies are defeated, you will earn additional currency that can be used to purchase more towers and soldiers or upgrade existing ones. Upgrades can improve the attack power, range, or other abilities of your towers and soldiers.

The game continues with waves of increasing difficulty. Each wave may introduce new types of enemies with different strengths and weaknesses. Adapt your strategy by purchasing new units or upgrading existing ones to counter the enemy threats.

The game ends if any enemy reaches your headquarters. Try to survive as many waves as possible and achieve the highest score.
